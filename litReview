Identifying Player Archetypes in Women’s Hockey
- premise: Identifying different types of players
- inspiration: astrophysics research to identify groups of stars with clustering algorithms
- find similar instances of the methodology in other sports
- 2021 data didn’t have other players on the ice at a time
- filter out team effect using indexing
- PCA
- clustering algorithms
- elbow method and silhouette method to aid in decision making
- really in-depth and informed analysis
- application to coaches
- web app of player archetypes using a radar chart

A Framework for Assessing Goal Scoring and Play Making Skill in the NWHL
- looking at hockey through the lens of opportunity, luck, and skill
- using xg to quantify a shooter’s skill and a passers passing ability
- created own xg model
- used glm’s to evaluate player effects relative to xg and player effects with respect to future xg as a result of their passes
- random forest for xg, use downsampling to account for the rarity of goals
- fixed effects and random effects, I don’ t understand those very well. GLMM
- gaussian distribution and stat knowledge allowed him to do some shortcuts
- application to line combinations 
- inspiration from NFL big data bowl

Quantifying offensive passing ability with expected primary assists
- came with a shiny app
- New Metric: xPA (expected primary assists)
- break down the problem into two parts: to calculate the likelihood of a pass leading to a goal we need to calculate the probability that a the pass is completed and then calculate the probability that the resulting shot goes in the net
- NFL inspiration
- xgboost for pass completion probability using time remaining, strength state, score differential, and classication of common types of passes
- made a new xg model
- AUC results 
- using phantom shots to account for when someone made a pass but the shooter decided not to shoot. This can help quantify the added value of “the extra pass”
- giving context to a new stat definition 
- used a sankey plot and a characteristic plot
- application: finding under appreciated players

How Do We Get There: Quantifying Pass Types and Their Value
- identifying the value of player shots and movements, including the actions that occur before a potential assist
- new stat: Expected Attack Value (EAV) for every pass, movement, or shot based on how an action sets up future actions
- inspired by linear weights in baseball and expected threat (xT) in soccer
Movement score: from a pass or a carry without losing possession. Looks like a transition probability
- running a formula iteratively
- discrepancy between different stats shows that they are measuring and valuing different things  
- he did do specific player analysis
- common pass types
- Gaussian Mixture Model (for clustering pass types)

The Pass is Right: An Analysis of Decision Making to Improve eScoring Chances in Women’s Hockey
- analyze key factors to improve in-game pass/shoot decisions to better capitalize on offensive opportunities 
- win probability model
- pass completion probability (auc, good for imbalanced classification problems)
- expected goals (David sumpter’s method)
- expected pass/shot rate: predict an action a player might take at any point during a hockey game (xgboost)
- only looked at passes for decision-making evaluation 
- 2 new metrics: Pass Risk, Pass Reward
- comparing average goals scored to xg

Net Front Presents: A Guide to Getting the Most of your Trip to the Crease
- deflections 
- comparing OHL to NWHL leagues
- using a log function for better results
- standardizing the data in the x,y coordinates
- application: using “micro-stats” to find out which players are “specialists”

Valuing Individual Contributing Events (V-ICE) in Hockey
- relative contributions of non-goal events in hockey
- New Stat: VAEP evaluates how individual actions contribute to an eventual expected goal (or prevent an eventual opponent’s expected goal)
- using a time-based window instead of an event-based window, based on intuition
- LightGBM with max xG in the 25 second window was the target
- xgboost with scale_pos_weight to better account for assigning goals than non-goals
- target of max expected goal output over the next n seconds (LightGBM) with MSE and same architecture as shot probability model
- application: evaluate individual players and teams as a whole, uncover strategic insights about a team’s style of play
- getting enough data to do stability analysis and other meta-checks
- tactics and tendency scouting, rating short direct and long indirect passes (since they contribute to scoring chances the most)

Hot Routes: An analysis of power play entry paths
- evaluate common entry routes, 
- claim that complex routes do not help teams enter the zone more
- dynamic time warping was used to account for possessions of different lengths
- used a hierarchical model with clustering
- restricted to successful carry-in rushes
- lots of outliers were present
- entry strategies could come as response to the defenders strategy

Uitilizing decision Trees with Expected Goals to Understand High-Probability Scoring Chances in Women’s Hockey
- “just” an xg model
- used logistic regression

Passing Patterns, Passing Efficiency, and Expected Goals on the Power play
- focus on the types of passes that lead to high efficiency and effectiveness
- what types of passes and how many of those passes resulted in the best scoring opportunities
- isolated for power play data separate from even strength
- made an xg model
- did pass clustering
- looked at different types of passes that occurred before shots
- excluded shots directly off of rebounds
- I barely skimmed this one

Projecting Win Probability in Women’s Hockey
- objective was to find the best way to measure a player’s contribution to a game
- drawing from basketball’s win probability added (WPA)
- they want to use it as a tool to measure efficiency
- adapted the soccer expected threat (xT) model to make a new metric called (nxT)
- SMOTE for class imbalance
- xgboost classification
- bayesian optimization from the Hyperopt package to optimize the F1-Score

VAEP in Hockey to put a value on zone Entries
- draws from soccer
- didn’t understand dump and chase, which is a type of zone entry
- made an xg model, and then extended it to have an xg model for non-shot events
- used a grid search parameter estimator
- xgboost classifier
- analyzing the players who are best at zone entries
- carrying the puck into the zone is incredibly valuable

Increasing Offensive Efficiency in the NCAA Women’s Ice Hockey
- used logistic regression
- used Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the data
- confusion matrix, recall, precision, f1-score, support, accuracy
- looked at the ROC curve

How important are face-offs to possession in women’s hockey?
- old idea with novel data
- face-offs aren’t as important as they’re made out to be
- subject matter: no body checking puts an emphasis on puck possession and passing
- net shots after face-off wins
- isolated face-off wins that ended in a shot
- impact of face-offs in sustained pressure 
- dealing with a small sample size
- looking at historical data to validate results and hypotheses

Teamwork Makes the Dream Work - Determining Which Pass Types Create High Quality Chances in Women’s Hockey
- not all passes are created equally
- group passes into available clusters
- build an xg model
- develop a method of valuing individual passes in a given possession
- filtering just for 5 on 5 play
- k means clustering on different pass types
- inspired by soccer: xGChain and xGBuildup
- had to define their own possession metrics and make a possessionxG
- by their definition, a possession can only have 1 shot
- allocate a proportion of the possession value to each based based on how close they were to the shot
- removing shot assists to get a better idea 
- team specific stats

Evaluating the 2019-20 Erie Otters through Markov Models
- LOOKS COOL
- drew inspiration from soccer and football
- 5v5 
- defined 23 geographic zones, inspired from the blue jackets analytics conference
- goal contribution
- drew off of Ron Yurko’s work
- soccer non-shot expected zone models
- improvement for geographic zones based on defensive pressure and other contextual information
- asked about stability and repeatability
- analyze the incremental value that a play adds to a goal

Bayesian Space-Time Models for Expected Possession added Value
- even strength possessions that begin with an entry and end with an exit or a whistle
- new metric: Possession Added Value (PAV)
- drew from: offensive sequences in hockey, xT, and a multi resolution stochastic process model for predicting basketball possession outcomes (basketball)
- THEY USED A MARKOV DECISION PROCESS to figure out how an offensive sequence develops 
- they used INLA to estimate spatial distributions
- they made a bunch of simulations and got xg from them to get the value of a sequence at a moment in time: xPv
- findings were obvious but good
- dump ins as a zone entry are still positive
- a drawback is the lack of information on how the opposing team’s defensive structure influences a player’s decision-making
- the valuable area of ice decreases over time. Why?
- overview metric
- in depth player evaluation using their new metric
- allowed the maps to evolve with an AR1 process
- theirs is super complicated but incredibly cool
